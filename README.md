# CS210-SNHU


Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This program gets user input for the time.  The time is entered in 24 hour format, user is asked for the hour, minutes and seconds.  The program then converts the time to a 12 hour clock and displays both a 12 hour clock and a 24 hour clock.

What did you do particularly well?
In this program I had to display the clocks with formatting.  I did the formatting well for this project.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I would enhance the code by adding classes to make the main file smaller and the program more readable as a whole.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?.
Converting the time while adding a minute, hour, or second was the most difficult for me.  I used many resources to try and figure out how to correct the issue.  I used cplusplus.com to also help me along with videos from YouTube for visual learning.  I will be adding Cplusplus.com for future reference for when I have questions on how and why something works or does not work.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
This program requires the basic knowledge of C++.  I learned how to make notes, and space code correctly to it is more readable.  I also learned how create a menu display that will be very useful for other project that require a display.  

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made proper notes and used spacing to make the program more readable.  I also divided the program into differenct sections so it is easy to see where the 24 hour clock code is and where the 12 hour code is.
